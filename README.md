Graphics library intended to simplify the combination of various ways of drawing things in the browser - Canvas, SVG, DOM, whatever. You just create and manipulate a "scene" populated with abstract entities, choose what "style" each entity should have, and call render.

Will hopefully make it easier to use the good parts of each approach - so, for example, I can draw squiggly raster lines between nice vector shapes filled with DOM-my textboxes. That's all I really want.
